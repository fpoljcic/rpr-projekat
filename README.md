This repository was used for development of a JavaFX desktop application with the following subject:

<p align="center">
  <b>Aplikacija za evidenciju ocjena studenata na fakultetu (e-Index)</b>
</p>

It is used for tracking students and professors, their subjects and grades. There is also an administrator that can manage the whole app.

The login credentials can be found in the [Login.txt](https://github.com/fpoljcic/rpr-projekat/blob/master/Login.txt) file.

An executable jar version of the app can be found in the exe folder. There is also a shortcut you can place anywhere and run the app with it.
